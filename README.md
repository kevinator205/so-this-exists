# so-this-exists
hwy do i exist
somebody once told me this github thing was gonna tutorial me
on how to learn how to code
it sure didnt work and now im confused
what has my life led up to
this is getting boring so i might just quit
but in the meantime im gonna write you a song
oh
i ate a jar of pickles
the whole thing by the way
it wasnt very healty
so i threw up the other day
i got over it kinda quickly
so thats a good thing i guess
i played a game of 'scotch
i dont know why but i did
might have been because
i actually had some earlier
oh
hey now
i'm a dropout
of all my life choices
hey now
i'm a failiure
so don't expect me to win
hey now
i hate my life
it's a sad thing that i do
hey now
this is a song
from the freaking shrek movie
